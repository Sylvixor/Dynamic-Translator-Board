This document details how the json's can be structured.

Firstly the status json send from the Pi to the Module.

Basic:

json = {
	"status" : (INT)
}

json = {
	"status" : (INT),
	"target"  : (STRING),
	"newValue" : (INT)
}

Extra feaures;
-change intervalMeasurement
-change intervalDataRequest
-change sensorPrepareTime
-change i2cAddress
-change modulePriority
-change i2c baudrate

Status codes:
-1	| switch data_request to InfoJson
-2	| makes sensor measurement, switches data_request to sensorMeasurementComplete
-3	| switch data_request to sensorData
-4	| change setting in flash


The Set-up json the Module sends to the Pi:

json = {
	"sM" : (INT),	(sensorModuleId	  )	|The unique Id of the sensorModule.
	"iC" : (INT),   (i2cAddress   	  ) |The I2C address of the sensorModule.
	"mI" : (INT),  	(measureInterval  )	|The standard time between measurements in secs.
	"sI" : (int),  	(senseInterval	  )	|The minimum time the Pi has to wait for a measurement to be made in secs.
	"mP" : (INT),   (modulePriority   ) |The priority of the module, a lower priority means that the module will be shut-off earlier in case of power emergency.
	"sT" : (INT) ,  (sensorPrepareTime)	|The time it takes for a sensor to be ready for measurements, this time is used if a sensor has a start-up time/warm-up time. Default = 0
}
	
	
The json send from the module back to the PI with the sensor readings:

json = {
	"sM" : (INT),	(sensorModuleId	  )	|The unique Id of the sensorModule.
	"d0" : float,	(data0)
	"d1" : float,	(data1)
	"d2" : float,	(data2)
	etc.
}
